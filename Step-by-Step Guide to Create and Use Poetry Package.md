## Step-by-Step Guide to Create and Use Poetry Package Manager

### 1. Install Poetry

The recommended way to install Poetry is by running the official installation script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

- This installs Poetry to your user directory (e.g., `~/.local/bin` on Unix systems).
- After installation, add Poetry to your PATH if it's not already:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

- Verify installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

Alternatively, you can install Poetry using `pipx` for isolated environment management:

```bash
pipx install poetry
```


---

### 2. Initialize a New Poetry Project

Navigate to your project directory or create a new one:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Initialize a new Poetry project interactively:

```bash
poetry init
```

- You will be prompted to enter project details such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.
- You can accept defaults or specify your own.
- This generates a `pyproject.toml` file which manages your project metadata and dependencies.

---

### 3. Add Dependencies

To add packages as dependencies, use:

```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

For example:

```bash
poetry add pandas requests
```

This updates `pyproject.toml` and installs the packages in an isolated virtual environment managed by Poetry.

---

### 4. Install Dependencies

To install all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` (including those added manually or from version control):

```bash
poetry install
```

This will create and manage a virtual environment automatically.

---

### 5. Use the Virtual Environment

To run commands inside the Poetry-managed virtual environment, use:

```bash
poetry shell
```

This activates the environment in your shell.

Alternatively, run a command directly inside the environment without activating it:

```bash
poetry run python script.py
```


---

### 6. Manage Project Scripts and Build

- Define scripts in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.poetry.scripts]` to create CLI commands.
- To build your package for distribution:

```bash
poetry build
```

- To publish your package to PyPI:

```bash
poetry publish
```

You will need PyPI credentials configured or use an API token.
